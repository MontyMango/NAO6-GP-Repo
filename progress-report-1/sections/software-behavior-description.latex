\section{Software Behavior Description}

\subsection{Software Behavior Summary}

The software interacts with the user through the microphone, sensors,
and camera of the \naosix\ robot. When the user begins speaking, the
\code{ALSoundDetection} API activates the microphone and begins
recording. The recording continues until two seconds of silence are
detected. The recording is then stored locally and transmitted to the
backend server via HTTP.

The backend server, running as a Node.js container, forwards the
recording to a voice recognition Docker container. The voice recognition
container returns a transcription of the voice recording back to the
Node.js container. The Node.js container then passes the transcription
to Ollama for response generation. Ollama processes the input and
generates a response using one of the Large Language Models (LLMs) that
it supports. The response is then sent back to the Node.js container.
The server then transmits the response to the \naosix\ robot, which
delivers a performance of the AI-generated response through speech and
animations.

If communication with the server fails or a non-200 status code is
received, due to voice recognition errors or connection issues, an error
message is generated and read aloud by the robot.

\subsection{Future Enhancements}

In later development phases, additional features will be implemented to
enhance user interaction. These include the following.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    A web-based interface for interacting with the chatbot, expanding
    the interface beyond the robot.

  \item
    The ability to switch between different LLMs to customize chatbot
    responses.

  \item
    User-defined topics, such as daily conversations, math assistance,
    and more, for tailored interactions.
\end{itemize}

The interaction with the software currently only involves one user. That
is the user directly interacting with the \naosix\ robot. This is
illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:user_diagram} below.
