\section{Project Schedule}

The project includes aspirational enhancements that may be integrated
based on feasibility and time constraints. Completion remains set for no
later than the end of the Spring 2025 academic semester, with regular
reviews to assess progress. The goal for February is to implement a
minimum viable client-server model that facilitates communication
between Ollama and the \naosix\ using Node.js on the server side. For
March and April, the project will be in full swing with feature
development. Late April into early May, the project must be finalized.
