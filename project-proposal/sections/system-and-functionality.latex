\section{System and Functionality}

\subsection{Overview of the System}

The goal of our project is to design and prototype an educational and
entertaining application for the \naosix\ humanoid robot owned by the
Computer Science Department of Indiana University South Bend. The core
feature will be a LLM-powered chatbot. The \naosix\ robot is developed
by SoftBanks Robotics. It is equipped with Intel Atom x5-Z8350 quad-core
processor, 2GB of memory, and 8 GB eMMC storage to support a range of
interactive applications. In addition, it is equipped with advanced
motion capabilities, touch and distance sensors, camera and vision, and
voice recognition features. It is a highly-engaging tool for children,
students, and seniors.

We propose utilizing a remote server to extend the robot's capabilities.
Our system will consist of a Docker container running on a remote SSH
server, which includes the full application. When users interact with
the \naosix\ robot, the robot will send user input to the backend of a
web application. The backend will then forward the input to an LLM model
API, receives the response, and send it back to the robot. The \naosix\
robot will then vocalize the response to the user. Additionally, we plan
to integrate entertaining animations into the robot's interactions. Last
but not the least, we will develop a web-based user interface to
facilitate interaction with the application.

A schematic diagram of the system architecture is shown in Fig.

\subsection{Key Functions to be Retained}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \naosix\ features: full-body movements, touch sensors, infrared and
    sonar sensors, voice recognition, and 360\textdegree\ vision.

  \item
    Existing \naosix\ apps such as \textit{Presentation}, \textit{Follow
    Me}, etc.

  \item
    WiFi and SSH connectivity of the \naosix\ robot.
\end{itemize}
