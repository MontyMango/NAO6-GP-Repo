Additionally, the members of the group intend to meet once per week on
Monday mornings as scheduling allows. Not everyone in the group has a
regular schedule, so some flexibility is required. Some weeks, the group
members may meet on alternate days and at alternate times. Naturally,
the group members will also meet each week during the scheduled class
period.
