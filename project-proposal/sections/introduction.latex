\section{Introduction}

Humanoid robots frequently make the news, especially in early January
during the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Many are fond of them
for their human-like characteristics and abilities. It seems many are
just as wary of these machines. Large Language Models (LLMs) have much
the same reputation. They are seen as an emerging technology that has
not yet been tamed. In an effort to combine these two innovations, the
members of this group will put forth in this proposal a project
involving the \naosix\ humanoid robot, Ollama, and a web user interface.
The main application will be hosted on a server in Docker, and the
project will be concluded in late April.
