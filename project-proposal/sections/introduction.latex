\section{Introduction}

This project aims to develop an interactive and educational chatbot
application for the \naosix humanoid robot, enhancing its capabilities
through large language model (LLM) integration. Hosted by the Computer
Science Department at Indiana University South Bend, the \naosix robot
will leverage advanced AI to engage users in meaningful conversations
while performing interactive animations.

To achieve this, the system will utilize a remote server running a
Docker-based application, enabling seamless communication between the
\naosix robot and an LLM-powered backend. User inputs will be processed
via a web application, allowing for real-time interactions and voice
responses. Additional features, such as an intuitive web interface and
entertaining animations, will further enhance the user experience.
