\section{Background and Objective}

The \naosix\ humanoid robot is widely used in education, research, and
human-robot interaction studies. It serves as a powerful tool for
teaching programming, artificial intelligence, and robotics concepts in
classrooms and universities. In therapy and special education, \naosix\
helps engage children with autism by providing structured interactions
and social skill development. Businesses and public spaces use \naosix\
for engaging customers, guiding visitors, and delivering interactive
presentations. With its ability to recognize speech, perform gestures,
and respond intelligently, the \naosix\ is a versatile platform for
exploring AI-driven communication and human-centered robotics.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in everyday applications to
improve communication and streamline tasks. They are integrated into
customer service chatbots, providing real-time support and resolving
queries efficiently. In education, LLMs assist with tutoring by
answering questions, explaining concepts, and offering personalized
learning experiences. When combined with robots like the \naosix, LLMs
enhance human-robot interactions by enabling robots to engage in more
natural, intelligent conversations, making them valuable tools for
education, research, and entertainment.
